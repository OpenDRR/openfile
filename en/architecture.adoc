== Architecture

Brief description of achitecture with goals/principles.

Source data for this project includes the National Human Settlement Layers (physical exposure and social vulnerability), the National Seismic Risk model for Canada (CanadaSRM2, probabilistic), Canadaâ€™s National Earthquake Scenario Catalogue (deterministic), and boundary geometries are stored in the Open Disaster Risk Reduction Platform (OpenDRR) organisation on GitHub.

=== Data Processing Pipeline

The OpenDRR platform data processing pipeline is responsible for extracting, transforming and loading (ETL) data. It consists of several open source technologies, namely PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension, Python, ElasticSearch/Kibana, and PyGeoAPI. Each of the applications is containerized using separate Docker containers orchestrated with Docker-Compose.

The stack of technologies can be configured to run on a local machine with PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch environments running locally or can be configured to communicate with cloud deployments of these services. For example, the stack can be configured to communicate simultaneously with a PostgreSQL database on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS) and a Containerized ElasticSearch environment on an AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). A common use case is to run the ETL process on a local desktop or AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with a local containerized PostgreSQL environment and a cloud deployed ElasticSearch environment which can support a public or private application programming interface (API).

The ETL process currently relies on a main shell script titled 'add_data.sh' which downloads the required source data files including comma separated value (csv), and GeoPackages (gpkg) into the local filesystem and performs necessary transformations to load the data into a PostgreSQL database. The script is written to be flexible enough to load any number of conformant deterministic earthquake scenarios and national seismic risk model data? and allows some flexibility in the contents of the input data as long as a minimal number of required fields are present. Once the required source data has been loaded into the database, a number of Structured Query Language (SQL) scripts help transform the data into a framework of meaningful earthquake risk indicators which in turn gets pushed to ES/Kibana ??? . 

Discuss the postgresql database? Briefly?  Schemas?
The PostgreSQL database is created and has PostGIS extension enabled to allow for spatial data queries.   The source datas are loaded into their respected schema names and the results are generated into their respected schemas with results_ prefix.????

Results are calculated and/or aggregated at different spatial scales dependent on the data.  For National Human Settlement Layers the results are in settled areas.  The probabilistic and deterministic data are calculated at the building level and aggregated up to the settled area and census subdivision levels.

These results are aggregated at several different spatial scales, building, sauid, and csd level. The building level is the finest spatial resolution and aggregates all buildings of similar construction type for a given neighbourhood. The Sauid level of aggregation groups all building types across the whole neighbourhood polygon. The Census Sub-division (CSD) aggregation is a coarse aggregation of all assets within a given CSD as defined by Statistics Canada. 

=== Data Dissemination

The data dissemination architecture includes API's and applications that are designed to provide multiple channels for access to scientific datasets and products.

==== GitHub

OpenDRR data products are made available in Geopackage footnote:[https://www.ogc.org/standards/geopackage] (GPKG) format in their respective repositories on GitHub. Datasets can be found in release assets for each release of the product and so they are versioned to ensure that consumers are using the most up-to-date data. 

Checksums are also provided for each file in a dataset so that consumers can verify the integrity of the data, an important consideration for any data being used to support decision making.

==== API Stack

[#image-apis]
.OpenDRR API Stack
image::opendrr-apis.png[OpenDRR API Stack,400,float="right"]

The API stack is comprised of three REST endpoints:

===== OGC API - Features

https://geo-api.riskprofiler.ca

Complying with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) footnote:[https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/] standards, it provides a geospatial data endpoint for GIS application developers. It is implemented using pygeoapi footnote:[https://pygeoapi.io] deployed in a Docker container. Pygeoapi is connected to an Elasticsearch document store.

A developer portal is provided that can be used to formulate and test queries against the API. At the time writing the API supports basic querying due to the evolving nature of OGC API - Features Part 3: Filtering and the Common Query Language (CQL).

NOTE: pygoapi also provides an OGC API - Records footnote:[https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records/] endpoint that is being explored for future use as a metadata API.

===== Elasticsearch

https://api.riskprofiler.ca

The Elasticsearch API follows REST footnote:[https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm] best practices. Configured as a read-only (i.e.: HTTP GET verb) it allows for access to datasets and their properties. Using a proprietary query syntax, developers can issue queries to return summary statistics, geospatial features, and feature properties.

The Elasticsearch API provides data to the Kibana dashboard application footnote:[https://dashboard.riskprofiler.ca]. Developers can set up an account in the Kibana dashboard where query formulation and testing tools are provided.

===== Esri

The Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP) is a Government of Canada clearinghouse for geospatial data. The FGP provides enterprise-grade geospatial infrastructure and support services to facilitate the dissemination of data. OpenDRR datasets are hosted on the FGP and made available via Esri REST services for organizations that utilize Esri based tools and applications.

==== Kibana Dashboard

The Kibana footnote:[https://www.elastic.co/kibana/] Dashboard is intended to support a more sophisticated use case than that of RiskProfiler. Initially, it was imagined that RiskProfiler would serve all stakeholders however, after engaging with the risk community footnote:[URBC 2020], it was evident that a dashboarding application would be well received. 

The Dashboard allows users to create workspaces where they can collaborate with others on data visualizations and reports. The entirety of available data in OpenDRR is available to Dashboard users. These data are hosted in Elasticsearch and it is therefore identical with what is available via the Elasticsearch API. Users can add or link additional datasets to "mash-up" Pathways data with their own.

Users can create reports, data visualizations, and maps for an area of interest. Visualizations can be exported and embedded in presentations and websites. This is the first of such platform to be made available to the Public with national scale risk data.
