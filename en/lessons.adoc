== Lessons Learned
// draft: very early brainstorming; by no means complete

=== Open Source, Open Data, Open Science, Open Process

* (May seem scary at first?) but many benefits
* full openness, transparency, accountability
* GitHub platform offers a lot of features and flexibility that we need
* Industry best practices

* Mutually beneficial relationship with GEM (OpenQuake)
* pygeoapi
* etc.

=== Security

Example: Apache Log4j vulnerability

* We got confirmation from ITSEC that our ES endpoint was attacked. Since we were running 7.12.0 the attack failed.  Lesson: keep your software up to date.  (Credit: Joost,)
** https://xeraa.net/blog/2021_mitigate-log4j2-log4shell-elasticsearch/[Mitigate Log4j2 / Log4Shell in Elasticsearch]

* (a little bit about) keeping up-to-date vs. compatibility-breaking changes (e.g. Python 3.8 to 3.9); be prepared for extra work hours (manpower?) to resolve compatibility issues during upgrade...

=== [optional] The use of Agile principles on GitHub; benefits and challenges

=== [optional] opendrr.github.io got falsely flagged as phishing or malicious

* CIRA, Google, VirusTotal; took a while to get off e.g. Microsoft SmartScreen
* Possibly due to the use of non Canada.ca template on a non .ca domain?
* https://github.com/OpenDRR/opendrr/issues/122
