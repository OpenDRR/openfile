== Future Development
// draft: very early brainstorming; by no means complete

=== Risk Profiler (v1)

* Expected to be published before April 2022 (kudos to https://habitatseven.com/[HabitatSeven])

=== Increase in scope: Import and process other datasets besides earthquake

* Flood: https://github.com/NRCan/CanFlood (Open-source flood risk modelling toolbox)
* Wildfire
* Mudslides

=== Continued automation, optimization, etc.

* Increased use of GitHub Actions workflows
* Full CI (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery)
* Cost-savings (e.g. move off Git LFS wherever possible; cheaper alternatives...)
* More automated testing, to catch errors as early as possible (preferrably at the pull request stage)
* Test-driven development (TDD) / Bahaviour driven development (BDD)?

=== Promote the project

* as a model with example that that other groups (countries/governments/companies etc.) can use
* (as open-source project) invite participation from open-source, scientific community, and the general public
* through web site(s), seminars/talks, publications
