== Overview

[.text-justify]

GitHub was chosen as the platform to support the development of the science outputs and related software, documentation, and tools. While well known in the software development community, it is lesser-known in the science community. However, the core concepts behind GitHub (e.g., versioning, repositories) were more or less understood by key 
contributors. 

Where possible, runnable code is available to ensure transparency in the science. For example, an interested party could clone a repository and replicate a particular output, e.g., a dataset or even the entirety of the OpenDRR infrastructure. The platform makes heavy use of containerization and infrastructure as code technologies for rapid deployment on personal computing devices or the cloud.

Built-in features of GitHub such as continuous integration and deployment, community building, websites, and secure workspaces are tools for achieving an open and collaborative approach to science, one that seeks to build consensus and drive engagement throughout its lifecycle.

Due to the diversity of use cases and user profiles for the information products (e.g., maps, visualizations), it was clear that a single solution would not be sufficient. It was determined that a purpose-built web application and a dashboard environment would be required to meet the needs of all users.

The dashboard environment, provided by Kibana footnote:[https://dashboard.riskprofiler.ca] connects to an Elasticsearch document store. This environment is highly customizable and allows individuals and organizations to create public or private spaces where they can query and intuitively visualize all available data.

The purpose-built application, called RiskProfiler footnote:[https://riskprofiler.ca] is a custom web application. Built to be highly scalable and user-friendly, it seeks to communicate the key messages relating to natural hazard risk. It provides basic filtering and visualization in an area of interest, such as a community or region.

In the initial release, RiskProfiler will focus primarily on earthquake risk, but the intention is to include additional natural hazard risk assessments, e.g., flood, wildfire, landslides, and tsunami.
